      <h1><a>The <em>Cosmos</em> is another name for the universe.</h1></a>
      <h2>Using the word <em>cosmos</em> implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly system or entity.</h2>

        <em>Cosmotology</em> is the study of the cosmos, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos"></a> and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and philosophical systems have a cosmology.
        When cosmology is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

      <h3>HOW DOES COSMOS CORRELATE TO HUMANS?</h3>
      <p>
        Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In physical cosmology, the term cosmos is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular spacetime continuum within a (postulated) multiverse. Our particular cosmos, the observable universe, is generally capitalized as the Cosmos. <strong>Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.</strong>
